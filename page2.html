    <h1>Apple Giveaway</h1>
    <p1 id="secret"
      >Didi, I created a Gmail account, discord account, twitter account. I
      <br />
      created discord for chatting with my friends as they wanted me to play
      <br />
      Minecraft with me as we talk. I know that creating accounts is prohibited
      <br />
      for children and kids due to a major reason is security and privacy
      <br />
      on the internet. As I am a coder and programmer myself and have deep
      <br />
      knowledge of Cyber Theft, Cyber Security, Cyber Hacking, etc. I can assure
      <br />
      you that I will not send any IMPORTANT info on the web. Also, I know that
      <br />
      these are social media platforms and everybody knows these make people go
      <br />
      mad, don't focus on studies, and contain unwanted content(18+). I know
      <br />
      these and I assure you that I will use the web for good purposes only. Plus my
      <br />
      recommendations and feeds are all safe. I hope this is enough. Well I heard
      <br />
      today is 1st Aprl. Also, do not think this is not real, it is, But you are
      <br />
      already pranked. I hope you like it. It took a lot of time to make this!
      <br />
      Bye and do not kill me in real life. Also, another point to note that 
      <br />
      I did watch P@RN and masturbated for 1 day. I assure you that I did
      <br />
      all this in a week or so. This should in the future benefit
      <br />
      me in cyber porn cases in this bad world filled with expert hackers. Also, 
      <br />
      I am a cybersecurity expert(not official) trained 5 months or so. I 
      <br />
      do have deep knowledge of cyber sec, and I know the pros and cons pretty 
      <br />
      deeply. Plz.</p1
