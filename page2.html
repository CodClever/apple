    <h1>Apple Giveaway</h1>
    <p1 id="secret"
      >Didi, I created a Gmail account, discord account, twitter account. I
      <br />
      created discord for chatting with my friends as they wanted me to play
      <br />
      minecraft with me as we talk. I know that creating accounts are prohibated
      <br />
      for children and kids due to a major reason that is security and privacy
      <br />
      on the internet. As I am a coder and programmer myself and have deep
      <br />
      knowledge on Cyber Theft, Cyber Security, Cyber Hacking, etc. I can assure
      <br />
      you that I will not send any IMPORTANT info on the web. Also, I know that
      <br />
      these are social media platforms and everybody knows these make people go
      <br />
      mad, don't focus on studies and contain unwanted content(18+). I know
      <br />
      these and I assure you that I will use web for good purposes only. Plus my
      <br />
      reccomedations and feeds are all safe. I hope this is enough. Well I heard
      <br />

      <br />
      already pranked. I hoped you liked it. It took a lot of time to make this!
